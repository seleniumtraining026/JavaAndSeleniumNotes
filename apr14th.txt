so every class in Java directly or indireclty inherited by Object Class

		Polymorphism :


	compile time		runtime [will be discussed after Inheritance topic]
	static			Dynamic
	Early Binding 		Late Binding
	(Method Overloading)	(Method Oveririding)

		Method Overloading

i)change in data types
ii)variance in no of arguments
iii)chnage in order of arguments (not encourged)
		

Binding =  linking --> linking called and caller method

MEthod Overloading :

methods having same method name doing different tasks in same class 

sum(int,int)

sum(double,double)

sum(String,String)

Method Overriding :
_____________________

Method Signature = method name + arguments 

methods having same method name and also signature doing different taks in two different 
classes having Inheritance
