Exception Handling :




Exception means Runtime Error
when Exception Occurs program terminates without executing the rest of code


Exception in thread "main" java.lang.ArithmeticException: 
/ by zero
	at may12th.ExceptionDemo1.main(ExceptionDemo1.java:12)


To Overcome this Exception , we should handle it

In Java , We can use Exception Handling by using

try catch mechanishm

try  - block where you put the code which is Risky

try
{

Risky Code

}
catch(someException someObjName)
{

some UserFrinedly Code
}
finally
{

some default code to executed
}

valid combination of try ,catch mechanism

try 	catch
try 	catch	finally
try	finally
try	catch	catch
try	catch	catch	finally
